## How to cite DistributedWorkflows.jl

Please cite this package as follows if you use it in your work:

```
@misc{DistributedWorkflows,
  author    = {Dastur, Firoozeh and Zeyen, Max and Rahn, Mirko},
  title     = {DistributedWorkflows.jl - A Julia interface to a distributed 
               task-based workflow management system},
  year     = {2024},
  month    = {January},
  howpublished     = {\url{https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl}}
}
```

## Initial setup

1. DistributedWorkflows.jl requires the package manager Spack to install necessary binaries. Follow the steps from [Spack - Getting Started](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) to install Spack. You might also want to read [Spack - Basic Usage](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html) to learn basic usage of Spack.

   > ---
   > **Note:**
   >
   > If you already have Spack installed and sourced in your path, then you may skip the above step.
   >
   > ---

2. Next, download the respective binary for your system from the following: [Binaries for DistributedWorkflows.jl](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

   *OR* 

   Download the binary file specific to your operating system from one of the links below:

   > ---
   > **Note:**
   >
   > The binaries are all built for the `x86_64_v3` architechture
   >
   > ---

   * [Ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/download/v0.1.0/distributedworkflow_ubuntu22)
   * [Debian 11](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/download/v0.1.0/distributedworkflow_debian11)
   * [Debian 12](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/download/v0.1.0/distributedworkflow_debian12)
   * [Rocky Linux 8](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/download/v0.1.0/distributedworkflow_rockylinux8)
   * [Rocky Linux 9](https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl/releases/download/v0.1.0/distributedworkflow_rockylinux9)

3. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the directory where you saved your binary file and install it in a target location of your choice as follows:

   ```
   ./distributedworkflow_myOS --target zeda
   ```

   > ---
   > **Note:**
   >
   > Replace `myOs` with the specific name of the Linux distribution from the downloaded binary. For example, if you downloaded the binary file for Ubuntu 22, then you can run `./distributedworkflow_ubuntu22 --target zeda`.
   >
   > ---

   > ---
   > **Note:**
   >
   > You are free to choose any other target location besides `zeda`.
   >
   > ---

4. If the installation was successful, then running the following should load the required dependencies of `DistributedWorkflows.jl`.

   ```bash
   spack load distributedworkflow
   ```

   You can check the loaded packages by running:

   ```
   spack find --loaded
   ```

5. If you would like to visualise the workflows before compilation, it is advised to download [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) to be able to visualise it in different formats.

6. Now, we are set up to use DistributedWorkflows.jl to parallelise our application.

## DistributedWorkflows.jl

Once this package is registered at it can be installed similar to any Julia package by doing:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("DistributedWorkflows")
```

For now, doing the following should work:

1. Once you have the Julia REPL open, enter the package mode of julia and add the github repo as follows:

   ```julia
   ] add https://github.com/FiroozehDastur/DistributedWorkflows.jl.git
   ```

2. Once the package administrator has installed `DistributedWorkflows`, it can be loaded like any other Julia package by running `using DistributedWorkflows` in the Julia REPL.

## How to use DistributedWorkflows.jl

To use `DistributedWorkflows` to parallelise an application, the following steps are required:

1. Setting up your Julia application structure. <!-- that will be run in parallel. This can be a single `.jl` file with all the necessary methods, or multiple `.jl` files. -->
2. Designing a workflow in the form of a Petri net.
3. A serializer descriptor. If you are using Julia's default serializer then you can skip this step.
4. Setting up the workflow launcher.
5. Compile and execute.

### A Simple Example

With the following example, we demonstrate the usage with a simple "Hello World" example.

Assuming that we use Julia's native serializer, let's say we have the following Julia code to run:

```julia
function hello_julia(In1, In2)
  a1 = In1 * 2;
  a2 = In2 - 3;
  str = ["if you are reading this, then your application worked..."]
  arr = [a1, a2]
  g = gcd(arr)
  ar = [(In1, In2, a1, a2, g)]
  return [str, ar]
end
```

It could be stored in a file, say `hello.jl`. Based on this piece of code we can see that the workflow is a Petri net with 2 input places, 1 transition, and 2 output places.

The Petri net can now be constructed as follows:

```julia
# A Petri net with 2 input places and 2 output places

# create an empty Petri net called "hello_julia"
pn = PetriNet("hello_julia") 

# create the input and output places
p1 = place("input_file1") 
p2 = place("input_file2")
p3 = place("output_file1")
p4 = place("output_file2")

# add a transition
t = transition("hello_jl")

# connect all the places and transitions based on their connection type to the Petri net
connect(pn,[(p1, :in),(p2, :in),(p3, :out), (p4, :out)], t)

# Alternatively, each place and transition can be connected individually, as shown below:
#
# connect(pn, p1, :in)
# connect(pn, p2, :in)
# connect(pn, p3, :out)
# connect(pn, p4, :out)

# generate the workflow in the folder "tmp" under the home directory.
wf = generate_workflow(pn)
```

When working within an environment like IJulia or Pluto, it is possible to visualise the workflow before generating the XML format of it by running `show_workflow(pn)`.
It is also possible to generate a rendering and store it to disk by running `savefig(pn)`.
This call would save the workflow as a PNG in a default location.
The output for both methods would look like the image below:

![hello_julia_net](examples/images/hello_julia.png)

To visualise the workflow in one of the other formats and a specific path use `savefig(pnet::PetriNet, format::Symbol, path::String)`. For example, `savefig(pn, :svg, "home/usr/zeda/net")` generates an SVG of the above Petri net and stores it in the path `home/usr/zeda/net`.

> **Warning:**
>
> The renderer works best if you have graphviz installed on your system. For Ubuntu 22 you can do `apt install graphviz` to install it.

> ---
> **Note:**
>
> The number of transitions coincide with the number of Julia methods to execute. Each input/output token corresponds to a string containing the file name where data is stored.

### Testing the example locally
<!-- 1. write your Julia application to be executed in parallel -->
<!-- 2. create a Petri net with respect to the Julia code. This will be your workflow and the code will be linked and executed based on this Petri net. -->
<!-- 3. Before compiling the net, you can view it in a format of your choice as follows: -->
<!-- 4. Compile the workflow: -->
<!-- 5. Once the workflow is compiled successfully, we are ready to test it locally as follows: -->
<!-- Start the client -->
<!-- link the ports -->
<!-- submit workflow -->
<!-- your results will be stored in the following path if a path is not specified by you: -->

<!-- What to do if you have a custom serialiser??? -->
<!-- Follow the example below for using a custom Serialiser. For demonstration purposes we use hdf5, something else, and Oscar's specific serialiser. Link Oscar here as a Computer algebra system. -->

Assuming that you have a workflow Petri net stored in an accessible location, use the following function to compile the workflow:

```julia
compile_workflow(<workflow-name>.xpnet, "/path/to/build/location")
```

Next, start the client using

```julia
client(<number-of-workers>, "/path/to/nodefile", "rif-strategy")
```

As a next step, it is advisible to create a script with your workflow configuration (see the executor files in the examples folder), and submit your application using the ```submit_workflow()``` function.

Once your application runs through, the output files will be stored in your desired output location.

## Features

* Serializer agnostic, for details see [custom serialize](docs/src/Serialization/custom_serializer.md) section in the documentation.
* Reduced complexity in deploying your parallel application.
* Localised testing of workflow, before launching expensive cluster resources.
* Write your own `xpnet` file and compile your workflow using the `compile_workflow()` function. 
* You could also, generate a Petri net in Julia using `PetriNet()` and generate the `xpnet` file from the Petri net using `generate_workflow()` before compiling it.
* Visualise Petri net within the Julia REPL in multiple formats.

## Shortcomings

* At the moment, this package is only efficient and recommended for long running processes.
* Due to the underlying workflow manager, this package only supports the following operating systems:

  ```
  * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  * Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  ```
  However, we have provided binaries to some additional distributions that we are testing against. In case of any problems related to installation or setup, please get in touch with us.
